# CSPC - Computer Science for Physics and Chemistry

My coursework repository. Each practical is under PW<n>/Lab <X>/.

## Setup
Create the environment for a given lab:
    conda env create -f PW<n>/Lab\ <X>/environment.yml
    conda activate cspc

## PW1 - Lab A: Reproducible Foundations

**What I built:**
- Unit tests in `test_decay.py` verifying exponential decay physics, initial conditions, and negative rate validation.
- Performance benchmarking script (`speed.py`) comparing pure-Python loops against vectorised NumPy implementations.

**Speed comparison (loop vs NumPy):**
- loop   : 1.9497 s
- numpy  : 0.0002 s
- speed-up: 11577.2 x faster

**Tests:** all passing? yes

**Conclusion:**
- Vectorised NumPy binomial operations (`rng.binomial`) significantly outperform pure-Python atom-by-atom loops by eliminating interpreter overhead and inner loops.
- All three unit tests passed successfully, proving that vectorisation maintains statistical physical accuracy against the analytical law $N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$.
- Environment setup via Conda ensures seamless cross-machine execution and reproducibility.

**Reproducibility Test (Stretch Goal):**
- Tested with partner repository clone: The environment built seamlessly using `environment.yml` and all tests passed via `pytest -v` without requiring code modifications.

## PW1 --- Lab B: Data, Plotting, and Automation

**What the data showed:**
The observed radioactive decay dataset (`decay_observed.csv`) demonstrates a clear exponential decrease in remaining count over time.

**Comparison with analytical law:**
The observed scatter plot closely follows the smooth analytical decay curve $N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$, confirming that the empirical data strongly matches theoretical physical predictions.

**Snakemake pipeline:**
The Snakemake workflow automates the execution of `plot.py` to regenerate `figure.png` whenever the underlying dataset or code is updated, ensuring complete computational reproducibility.ss

## PW2 --- Lab A: Derivatives, Noise, and Integration

**What I built:**
- Computed velocity ($v$) and acceleration ($a$) from noisy free-fall position tracking data using `np.gradient`.
- Integrated acceleration back up to recover velocity ($v_{\text{rec}}$) and position ($y_{\text{rec}}$) using `scipy.integrate.cumulative_trapezoid`.
- Produced a 3-panel figure saved as `motion.png` showing position, velocity, and acceleration against time.

**Acceleration statistics:**
- Mean acceleration: -8.58 m/s²
- Standard deviation of acceleration: 28.72 m/s²
- Maximum difference between original and recovered position: 0.78 m

**Why acceleration was noisy:**
Numerical differentiation magnifies measurement noise because computing rates of change between adjacent time steps divides tiny random position fluctuations by very small time intervals ($\Delta t$), causing two successive derivatives to swing wildly even when the position curve appears smooth.

**What integrating back showed:**
Numerical integration suppresses random noise because summing up values step-by-step allows positive and negative fluctuations to cancel out. The recovered position matched the original trajectory within 0.78 m despite the extreme noise in the acceleration data.

**Bonus (2D Trajectory):**
- Analyzed `trajectory.csv` by computing $v_x = \frac{dx}{dt}$ and $v_y = \frac{dy}{dt}$ using `np.gradient`.
- Calculated overall speed $\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$ and saved the visualizations as `trajectory.png`.
